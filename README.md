## Tracking with Kernelized Correlation Filters

Code author : Tomas Vojir

________________

This is a C++ reimplementation of algorithm presented in "High-Speed Tracking with Kernelized Correlation Filters" paper.
For more info and implementation in other languages visit the [autor's webpage!](http://home.isr.uc.pt/~henriques/circulant/).

It is extended by a scale estimation (use several *7* different scales steps) and
by a RGB (channels) and Color Names [2] features. Data for Color Names features were obtained from [SAMF tracker](https://github.com/ihpdep/samf).

It is free for research use. If you find it useful or use it in your research, please acknowledge my git repository
and cite the original paper [1].

The code depends on OpenCV 2.4+ library and is build via cmake toolchain.

_________________
Quick start guide

for linux: open terminal in the directory with the code

$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; make

This code compiles into binary **kcf_vot**

./kcf_vot
- using VOT 2014 methodology (http://www.votchallenge.net/)
 - INPUT : expecting two files, images.txt (list of sequence images with absolute path) and
           region.txt with initial bounding box in the first frame in format "top_left_x, top_left_y, width, height" or
           four corner points listed clockwise starting from bottom left corner.
 - OUTPUT : output.txt containing the bounding boxes in the format "top_left_x, top_left_y, width, height"

./kcf_trax
- using VOT 2014+ trax protocol (http://www.votchallenge.net/)
- require [trax](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax) library to be compiled
  with opencv support and installed. See trax instruction for compiling and
  installing.
